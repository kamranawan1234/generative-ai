# Genetic Algorithm Visualizer


## Introduction
Evolutionary computation is a way to solve problems by using ideas from natural evolution. Many beginners find it hard to understand how evolutionary algorithms work. Selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement can be confusing when they are only read about in books.
This project is a graphical application that shows how a genetic algorithm works. The application lets users see how a population changes over time. Users can watch how the operators affect individuals in each generation. This makes learning easier because users can see the process instead of only reading about it.
The application uses a genetic algorithm. Each individual is represented as a string of genes. The genes can be active or inactive. Selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement operators are applied to the population in each generation. The application shows each operator visually so users can see what happens during the algorithm.
This project is an educational tool. It is not an experiment. Its purpose is to help users understand evolutionary algorithms by watching the process in real time. The application allows beginners to learn faster and more clearly by seeing the algorithm work step by step.
The program also gives users control over some important settings. Users can change the population size, the crossover rate, and the mutation rate. They can start and stop the simulation, step through each generation, and reset the population. These controls let users explore how changing the parameters affects the evolution.
